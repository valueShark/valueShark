            <p>My name is Chase Tucker and I am a Back-End Developer. I have a passion for turning ideas into delightful solutions.
                I am a veteran, a former Manufacturing Manager and Analyst. While working in manufacturing, I recognized that
                software had the greatest potential to overcome our greatest challenges. Pursued C.S. degree part-time while working,
                but realized the fastest path to my passion was through attending a code school. I excel at building powerful data
                pipelines and serving them up to create beautiful user experiences. I believe my diverse background and skill set
                give me the tools I need to tackle any challenge.</p>

            <p>I graduated from the University of Washington in 2016 with a BS in Biochemistry. After spending a total of nearly a decade
                in the health care sector, I'm excited to get my feet wet in software development; learning about how and why computers work
                the way they do is profoundly similar to learning a biochemical pathway, and that's what gets me excited every single day
                about going into this sector. I look forward to making an impact in the industry by working on both sides of the stack to
                give an astounding user experience.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Hi, my name is Ashlyn and I am passionate about creating software that helps ease the burden of business and life in general.
                I believe that technology is something that can enhance anyoneâ€™s life and business, and have seen that in my own life.
                I formerly worked as an Accounts Executive for a coffee company and utilized different tech applications to streamline operations
                at the company, making it more efficient and increasing profits. I decided that I wanted to be the one to create those technologies
                that I was using, so I began my journey into the tech industry. I really value helping others, organization, efficiency and
                creativity and the fact that I can combine all of that into a career that helps other people is really exciting to me.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I'm Lucas, a software developer and Air Force veteran.
                I enjoy problem solving and working with computers, so after my time in the Air Force I started work at a data center, which is where my interest in software development began.
                I eventually decided to pursue software full time and enrolled at Code Fellows, which is where I helped create this project.
